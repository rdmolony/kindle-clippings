When the U.S. Navy needed to plan the Polaris submarine project, they adopted this style of estimating with a methodology they called the Program Evaluation Review Technique, or PERT. Every PERT task has an optimistic, a most likely, and a pessimistic estimate. The tasks are arranged into a dependency network, and then you use some simple statistics to identify likely best and worst times for the overall project.

Throughout history, influenza and its ability to quickly kill many millions during a global pandemic has earned it the status of king of infectious diseases. An infected human can efficiently transmit the flu virus to people around him, and unlike someone infected with Ebola, say, he can do this even before he shows signs of being sick. All that is required is to breathe the contaminated air just exhaled or coughed from the lungs of an infected person.

After several weeks of coding this way, the program suddenly stops working, and after hours of trying to fix it, he still doesn’t know why. Fred may well spend a significant amount of time chasing this piece of code around without ever being able to fix it.

Finding bugs is somewhat like fishing with a net. We use fine, small nets (unit tests) to catch the minnows, and big, coarse nets (integration tests) to catch the killer sharks. Sometimes the fish manage to escape, so we patch any holes that we find, in hopes of catching more and more slippery defects that are swimming about in our project pool.

Tracer code is not disposable: you write it for keeps. It contains all the error checking, structuring, documentation, and self-checking that any piece of production code has. It simply is not fully functional. However, once you have achieved an end-to-end connection among the components of your system, you can check how close to the target you are, adjusting if necessary.

The conventional alternative is a kind of heavy engineering approach: code is divided into modules, which are coded in a vacuum. Modules are combined into subassemblies, which are then further combined, until one day you have a complete application. Only then can the application as a whole be presented to the user and tested.

In late position (sixth to act) or on the button you don't want to raise more than three times the big blind. Your bet is now more likely to be interpreted as a stealing attempt and less as a value bet, and you want to encourage action, since the hands that call you will be a little weaker than usual.

Although I recommended a very occasional call with these hands in an unopened pot, I don't recommend that here. Limping in after one limper has already entered will just encourage several other limpers to come in after you, and that creates exactly the situation you don't want with a premium pair: a small pot with many players.

88 through 22: In this situation, the small pairs benefit from what's called the umbrella effect. With one extra caller in the pot, calling with the small pairs gets you slightly better pot odds. As a result, you can call with eights, sevens, and sixes.

A9 through A2: Fold all these hands. This may seem an exceptionally conservative strategy, but if you are playing these hands, you'll often find yourself up against an initial caller who had ace-x and x is a higher kicker than yours.

Before playing your suited connectors, make sure that the limpers aren't on short stacks. It's the big implied odds when you hit your straight or flush that makes this an attractive call, but if your opponents are short-stacked, you won't be able to win enough chips to make the play worthwhile.

One characteristic problem of weak no-limit hold 'em players is calling too much before the flop, particularly in the early stages of tournaments. Their motivation is easy to understand. Calling is very cheap compared to their chip stack. Any hand can theoretically turn into a monster on the flop. When a weak hand flops a monster, it's more likely to be disguised than a strong hand.

The existence of the Sandwich Effect allows for a special kind of move called the "Squeeze Play." Imagine you have an early raiser, who may or may not have a strong hand, followed by a caller. When a player in late position now tosses in another raise, the original raiser is caught in a squeeze. The player in late position has shown strength and may have him beaten. But if the original raiser calls to see a flop, the caller, who might have been trapping with a strong hand, can raise as well. Under the circumstances, the original raiser needs a huge hand to continue playing, and will often elect to throw his hand away.

It's easy to see why all-in bets should be rare. If you have plenty of chips and your hand is very strong, say aces or kings, then you want to use the hand to make a lot of money. An all-in bet will mostly chase the other players out of the pot, and you'll only make the blinds and antes.

What's the best way to play so as to extract an extra bet from your opponent? To most beginners and many intermediates, this question seems incredibly pedestrian.

Note first of all that if your opponent had been a strong player, he probably wouldn't have played the hand this way. Holding, say, a queen-ten, you don't want just to call on the flop because you won't know what to do if you then face another bet on fourth street. You have top pair, but is it good, or are you beaten? You won't know. A better play is to try to settle the hand with a raise on the flop. If that wins the pot, great. If it doesn't win the pot, you're almost certainly beaten.

Among good players, all-in moves are a rare occurrence until they start getting short-stacked. The reason is pretty simple. When you go all-in, you're putting your whole tournament life at risk. Good players don't like to do this. They're confident of their ability to keep outplaying their opponents and accumulating chips, so they see time as being on their side.

Compare the merits of an all-in bet to the merits of betting just the size of the pot. If you have a strong hand and your opponent has a weak hand, either play will chase him away and claim the pot. If you have a strong hand, and your opponent has a weaker hand, but one which he still wants to play, a pot-sized bet is more likely to win some extra money than an all-in move.

If you have a strong hand, and your opponent has a weaker hand, but one which he still wants to play, a pot-sized bet is more likely to win some extra money than an all-in move. And if you have a good hand, but your opponent has a well-concealed monster, a pot-sized bet will give you at least one more chance to reconsider before you lose all your chips.

When you play poker, however, you can't simply bet when you have a hand and throw your cards away otherwise. If you do, even the most perceptually challenged opponents will eventually figure you out. Instead, you'll have to mix in some moves with your value bets, pretending to be strong when you have nothing, and pretending to be weak when you really have a hand.

How many players should you bluff? The fewer, the better. One is better than two, and two are better than three. Bluffing more players creates the appearance of a stronger hand, but increases the chance that someone may have a hand that's strong enough to call or raise your bet.

Completely missing the flop is a good indicator for a
continuation bet, since it costs you nothing extra to walk away from your hand when your move fails. If, however, you have a draw to a big hand, then a continuation bet could be a big mistake, giving your opponent another chance to chase you out of the pot.

A probe bet is similar to a continuation bet, but it is made when you were not the leader before the flop, but the leader has declined to make a move after the flop. A probe bet gives you a chance to win the pot immediately, but also helps define your hand by forcing the leader to make a play, either folding, calling or raising. Depending on his response, you'll have a clearer idea of how to play the hand.

(On the other hand, a player who rarely bets after the flop but who makes pot-sized bets when he does bet is just a super-tight player who wants the nuts before he commits his money. Play at him when he doesn't bet and stay away from him when he does.)

Continuation bets are a good tactic against a single opponent, or two at the most. If a (competent) opponent led out before the flop and was called by three or four players, and now leads out again after the flop, he's almost certainly got something and he's making a value bet, not a continuation bet. Stay out of the pot unless you too have a good hand.

The flop hit your hand, but you don't have a monster. Sometimes the flop will hit your hand and give you middle pair or bottom pair. Your hand certainly isn't a lock, but it is worth something. In general, if your opponent now makes a continuation-type bet, you should call it. Your game plan is to see what happens on fourth street, and take the pot away if he shows weakness.

When confronted with a probe bet, I like to employ the Travis Bickel Defense. "You wanna know somethin' about my hand? You talkin' to me? You talkin' to ME?!!," and then toss in a big raise. This usually takes the pot, and when it doesn't, I'm gone. (I don't actually start screaming, it's just a metaphor.)

Players who bet like this are usually thinking that a failure to bet will show weakness.

The great danger of slow-playing is that you may lose a big pot by allowing someone to catch free cards that eventually make a hand stronger than yours. It also has the problem that it sometimes results in winning a smaller pot than a non-slowplay would.

Who should you slow-play? The loose aggressive player is the best target because he will often actually make a bet. He likes to take pots away from players who seem weak, so checking to him is likely to induce the bet you need. Slow-playing the weak-tight player is likely to be both a waste of time and dangerous.

Suppose you're on the button, you raise with a pair of sixes, the small blind reraises you, and the big blind reraises him! Yes, they might both be raising with trash.

A squeeze play is basically just a bluff, and I don't like to use my hands that have genuine value on bluffs. I'd much prefer bluffing with a hand that's worthless, which I can cheerfully dump when someone plays back at me.

The key question for the conservative player is: "Just how often should I bluff?" My quick (and very general) answer here would be this: Given an average table and pretty much average cards (no extended runs of either hot or cold hands), about one bluff every hour and a half seems about right.

The key question for the conservative player is: "Just how often should I bluff?" My quick (and very general) answer here would be this: Given an average table and pretty much average cards (no extended runs of either hot or cold hands), about one bluff every hour and a half seems about right. That works out to about six bluffs in the course of a nine-hour playing session. If the table is moving along at 30 to 40 hands per hour, that's about one bluff every 50 to 60 hands.

Slow-playing is a less effective tactic for a player who is recognized as conservative. When such a player gets in a hand, he's presumed to have something. Passive calls or other indications of weakness will be viewed with suspicion.

The logic of these rules is pretty simple. A raise after your call doesn't necessarily indicate great strength, so you just need a good hand to continue. A raise after you have already raised indicates a very good hand, and restricting your calls to top-10 percent hands gives you a fighting chance of having the best hand in the showdown.

Most people who think about carbon footprints are used to the idea that each unit we consume causes a fixed quantity of CO2 emissions. However, the truth is somewhat more complex than that. A more meaningful way to think about the carbon footprint of your own electricity use is to think of it as being additional to all the power consumption that was already going on before you flicked on the light or appliance.

The proportion is also higher in the developed world, especially in those bits of it, like the UK, that are surrounded by sea.

When they have a strong draw, one with eight or more outs, their calling instinct coincides with correct strategy. They will see the river no matter what, and they should. But when your opponents have weak draws, those with fewer than eight outs, whether they can call profitably depends on the size of the bet and pot — that is, on their pot odds.

the only offsuit hand you should usually play against a raise is ace-king (also ace-queen against a loose raiser). The threat of domination devalues every other offsuit hand too much, even ace-queen (again, as long as the raiser is tight with his raises). Nevertheless, many of your opponents would always call with ace-ten, suited or offsuit, in this spot. It is a major error, one you must assiduously avoid. Never cold-call preflop raises with easily-dominated, offsuit hands.

When you are first to enter the pot from middle position, you are more likely than usual to play against only one or two others. As a result, some hands that prefer multiway action, particularly small pairs and small suited connectors, that should usually be played are no longer worth playing. For example, normally we recommend playing 2♥2♣ in middle position. But if you are three off the button, and nobody has yet entered the pot, you should fold.

Most games use a small blind that is half the size of the big blind. For instance, in a $4-$8 game, the small blind is typically $2 and the big blind $4. In this structure you can play quite loosely for $2 more. We recommend that you play any pocket pair, any two suited cards, and any two offsuit cards ten or higher. The ratio of the potential size of the final pot to your immediate investment (that is, your implied odds) is roughly double what it is outside the blinds.

Our advice is to follow the loose game guidelines until proven otherwise. That’s because at the small stakes there are so many confused and poorly-skilled players that failing to play the extra hands should prove far more costly those times when you should play them than they will save you those times you should throw them away.

The important difference between power lines and appliances is that for power lines, the current is unaffected by the resistance of the line itself, being determined instead by the load or power consumption at the end of the line (this is because the resistance of the line itself is very small and insignifcant compared to that of the appliances at the end, so that any reasonable change in the resistance of the line will have a negligible effect on the overall resistance, and thus the current fowing through it)

In fact, resistance and current are inversely proportional in this case: if one doubles, the other is halved.What, then, is the effect of resistance on power consumption? The key here is that resistive heating depends on the square of the current, meaning that the power is more sensitive to changes in current than resistance.Therefore, at constant voltage, the effect of a change in current outweighs the effect of the corresponding change in resistance. For example, decreasing the resistance (which, in and of itself, would tend to decrease resistive heating) causes the current to increase, which increases resistive heating by a greater factor.Thus, at constant voltage, the net effect of decreasing resistance is to increase power consumption. An appliance that draws more power has a lower internal resistance.

Applying the formula P ¼ I2R for resistive heating with the current held constant, we see that doubling the resistance of the power line will double resistive losses. Since in practice it is desirable to minimize resistive losses on power transmission and distribution lines, these conductors are chosen with the minimal resistance that is practically and economically feasible

We can map the feld conceptually by asking, for any location, “What force would be acting on a (positive) test charge if it were placed here?” Each time, the net force on the test charge would be a combination of one attractive force and one repulsive force, in different directions and at different strengths depending on the distance from the respective fxed charges

Rent control is initially imposed on the argument that the supply of housing is not “elastic”—i.e., that a housing shortage cannot be immediately made up, no matter how high rents are allowed to rise. Therefore, it is contended, the government, by forbidding increases in rents, protects tenants from extortion and exploitation without doing any real harm to landlords and without discouraging new construction. This argument is defective even on the assumption that the rent control will not long remain in effect. It overlooks an immediate consequence. If landlords are allowed to raise rents to reflect a monetary inflation and the true conditions of supply and demand, individual tenants will economize by taking less space. This will allow others to share the accommodations that are in short supply.

Suppose we take an industry like that of the railroads, for example, which cannot always pass increased wages along to the public in the form of higher rates, because government regulation will not permit it. It is at least possible for unions to make their gains in the short run at the expense of employers and investors. The investors once had liquid funds. But they have put them, say, into the railroad business. They have turned them into rails and roadbeds, freight cars and locomotives. Once their capital might have been turned into any of a thousand forms, but today it is trapped, so to speak, in one specific form. The railway unions may force them to accept smaller returns on this capital already invested.

The railway unions may force them to accept smaller returns on this capital already invested. It will pay the investors to continue running the railroad if they can earn anything at all above operating expenses, even if it is only one-tenth of one percent on their investment. But there is an inevitable corollary of this. If the money that they have invested in railroads now yields less than money they can invest in other lines, the investors will not put a cent more into railroads.

Most of these policies have been followed under the assumption that there is just a fixed amount of work to be done, a definite “job fund” which has to be spread over as many people and hours as possible so as not to use it up too soon. This assumption is utterly false. There is actually no limit to the amount of work to be done. Work creates work.

In an exchange economy everybody’s money income is somebody else’s cost. Every increase in hourly wages, unless or until compensated by an equal increase in hourly productivity, is an increase in costs of production. An increase in costs of production, where the government controls prices and forbids any price increase, takes the profit from marginal producers, forces them out of business, means a shrinkage in production and a growth in unemployment.

When the economy is free, demand so acts that some branches of production make what some government officials regard as “excessive,” “unreasonable,” or even “obscene” profits. But that very fact not only causes every firm in that line to expand its production to the utmost, and to reinvest its profits in more machinery and more employment; it also attracts new investors and producers from everywhere, until production in that line is great enough to meet demand, and the profits in it again fall to (or below) the general average level.

Even the clerk who used to get $75 a week and now gets $120 thinks that he must be in some way better off, though it costs him twice as much to live as it did when he was getting $75. He is of course not blind to the rise in the cost of living. But neither is he as fully aware of his real position as he would have been if his cost of living had not changed and if his money salary had been reduced to give him the same reduced purchasing power that he now has, in spite of his salary increase, because of higher prices. Inflation is the autosuggestion, the hypnotism, the anesthetic, that has dulled the pain of the operation for him. Inflation is the opium of the people.

To argue, on the basis of an extreme example, that the volume of real savings would not be reduced by a substantial reduction in the interest rate, is like arguing that the total production of sugar would not be reduced by a substantial fall of its price because the efficient, low-cost producers would still raise as much as before. The argument overlooks the marginal saver, and even, indeed, the great majority of savers.

It is the science of tracing the effects of some proposed or existing policy not only on some special interest in the short run, but on the general interest in the long run. This is the lesson that has been the special concern of this book. We stated it first in skeleton form, and then put flesh and skin on it through more than a score of practical applications. But in the course of specific illustration we have found hints of other general lessons; and we should do well to state these lessons to ourselves more clearly. In seeing that economics is a science of tracing consequences, we must have become aware that, like logic and mathematics, it is a science of recognizing inevitable implications.

During the whole of this modern period of European history the general direction of social development was one of freeing the individual from the ties which had bound him to the customary or prescribed ways in the pursuit of his ordinary activities. The conscious realisation that the spontaneous and uncontrolled efforts of individuals were capable of producing a complex order of economic activities could come only after this development had made some progress. The subsequent elaboration of a consistent argument in favour of economic freedom was the outcome of a free growth of economic activity which had been the undesigned and unforeseen by-product of political freedom.

It is necessary in the first instance that the parties in the market should be free to sell and buy at any price at which they can find a partner to the transaction, and that anybody should be free to produce, sell, and buy anything that may be produced or sold at all. And it is essential that the entry into the different trades should be open to all on equal terms, and that the law should not tolerate any attempts by individuals or groups to restrict this entry by open or concealed force. Any attempt to control prices or quantities of particular commodities deprives competition of its power of bringing about an effective co-ordination of individual efforts, because price changes then cease to register all the relevant changes in circumstances and no longer provide a reliable guide for the individual's actions.

Imagine you are the board of an airline and have just spent three hours debating whether to buy 13 Airbus A350s or 11 Boeing 787s, each of which costs around $150 million. At the end of the meeting, you are presented with an idea for an advertising campaign that does not show an aircraft at all, but instead proposes to focus on the cucumber sandwiches and scones that might be served on board. This is non-sense – however, around 90 per cent of people have no idea what sort of aircraft they are travelling on or how a jet engine works but will infer a great deal about the safety and quality of the experience offered by an airline from the care and attention it pays to on-board snacks.

Collective, self-serving argument can work well when people are in possession of all the pertinent facts, which is why it works well in the physical sciences, when all the pertinent variables are known, and can be numerically expressed. However, in the social sciences this simply does not apply – it is impossible to quantify many of the important psychological factors which people care about, and there are no SI units for what really matters.

Today, the principal activity of any publicly held company is rarely the creation of products to satisfy a market need. Management attention is instead largely directed towards the invention of plausible-sounding efficiency narratives to satisfy financial analysts, many of whom know nothing about the businesses they claim to analyse, beyond what they can read on a spreadsheet.

The tricky thing to keep in mind, therefore, is that if you earnestly seek truth, you have to look for what is going to work for the majority of the population, rather than just the genetic exceptions. When scientific studies are conducted to try to establish such an explanation, the findings can be misleading if the study happens to include one or more of these genetic anomalies.

People will see a group of champion swimmers and observe a certain appearance, or they’ll see a group of professional bodybuilders and observe another appearance, and it seems logical to assume that there is something about what these athletes are doing in their training that has created the way they appear. However, this assumption is a misapplication of observational statistics. If you should ever attend a national AAU swim meet and sit through the whole day’s competition, from the initial qualifiers to the finals, you would see these “swimmer’s bodies” change dramatically over the course of the day. This speaks to the fact that it isn’t the activity of swimming, per se, that produces this “type” of body; rather, a particular body type has emerged that is best suited for swimming.

Who could possibly remember the formula for the volume of a hexagonal prism? How could you make yourself care enough to actually remember? It was so much easier if you could see how all the pieces interrelated—how multiplication connected with the area of rectangles, how the area of rectangles connected with triangles and trapezoids, and how the volume of prisms connected back with multiplication. I didn’t have to memorize formulae; they were just examples of something much, much larger.

If you can internalize that pattern and make it automatic, you’ll save yourself a great deal of work. • The easiest way to internalize those patterns is to use your SRS. Create flash cards to memorize every spelling pattern you need. • In the process, approach foreign sounds and complex patterns from as many angles as you can—from their spellings to their sounds, even down to the individual mouth positions used for each sound. You’re taking advantage of one of the stranger quirks of learning: the more bits and pieces you learn, the less work it takes to learn them.

suppose that people falsely think that some risks (a nuclear power accident) are high, whereas others (a stroke) are relatively low. Such misperceptions can affect policy, because governments are likely to allocate their resources in a way that fits with people’s fears rather than in response to the most likely danger. When ‘availability bias’ is at work, both private and public decisions may be improved if judgments can be nudged back in the direction of true probabilities.

Don’t tag your notes into “categories” already created with decks or note types. For example, if you have a deck for a text book, with various sub-decks for each chapter, don’t tag your notes “chapter-1”, “chapter-2”, etc. because this is redundant and unnecessary. If you want to study a specific chapter then you could just study that sub-deck.

We encounter a broken word whenever we think a word is pronounced one way, but it’s actually pronounced a different way. These words can’t be shared between the written language and the spoken language, and as a result, they break up our little circle of friends.

So how do you learn to pronounce new sounds? What do the actors and singers know that everyone else doesn’t? It’s not all that complex. We simply know that the sounds we make are created by the movements of muscles in our mouths. We pick up an awareness of the everyday movements of our tongues and lips, and we combine them in a few new ways.

In general, you only need three pieces of information to make any sound: you need to know what to do with your tongue, with your lips, and with your vocal cords, and there aren’t that many options. Your vocal cords go on and off. That’s it—it’s the only difference between “ssss” and “zzzz.” When you’re speaking vowels, your lips are basically rounded like “oo” or not. That’s all. The rest of the IPA focuses upon the location and behavior of your tongue.
